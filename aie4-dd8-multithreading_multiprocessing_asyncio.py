Here is the result of a run:

=======================================================
=== I/O-Bound Task ===

Sequential Execution (I/O-bound):
I/O Task Complete
I/O Task Complete
I/O Task Complete
Sequential Execution Time: 3.00 seconds

Multithreading Execution (I/O-bound):
I/O Task Complete
I/O Task CompleteI/O Task Complete

Multithreading Execution Time: 1.00 seconds

Multiprocessing Execution (I/O-bound):
I/O Task Complete

Multiprocessing Execution Time: 1.21 seconds

Asyncio Execution (I/O-bound):
I/O Task Complete
I/O Task Complete
I/O Task Complete
Asyncio Execution Time: 1.01 seconds
========================================================

Explanation: You can see here that for IO-bound tasks, multithreading and multiprocessing
are faster than sequential execution.
Sequential execution requires a total of 3 seconds to complete all three tasks, while
multithreading and multiprocessing take only 1 second. This is because the I/O-bound tasks
are waiting for the sleep function to complete, and the threads and processes can run concurrently.

========================================================

Explanation: For CPU-bound tasks, multiprocessing is faster than sequential execution.
In this case, the CPU-bound task is finding prime numbers up to a limit.
The sequential execution requires a total of 6.57 seconds to complete all three tasks,
while multiprocessing takes only 4.37 seconds.
Multithreading is not faster than sequential execution because of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)
in Python, which prevents multiple threads from executing Python code simultaneously. Asyncio is
not suitable for CPU-bound tasks because it is designed for I/O-bound tasks and does not provide
true parallelism.
